In a statement such as:

```
PeopleCounter passengerCounter = new PeopleCounter();
```

A `PeopleCounter` class is used to define the type of variable, in this case an object of said class, that `passengerCounter` is meant to be. 

The variable is then instantiated as an object of `PeopleCounter` through the construction call `new PeopleCounter();`.
